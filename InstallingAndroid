The main issue with installing Android in Qubes is that the Android
installer expects to be installed in /dev/sda but Qubes presents disks
at /dev/xvdX.
This is discussed
[here](https://github.com/unman/notes/blob/master/disks_in_Qubes), and a
solution is outlined.

# Prepare the system
1. Download `init_patch` and `patch_init` from
https://github.com/unman/change_disk
2. Copy those files in to dom0.
    If the files were downloaded in qube1, then in dom0:
    `qvm-run -p qube1 'cat /home/user/Downloads/init_patch' > init_patch`
    `qvm-run -p qube1 'cat /home/user/Downloads/patch_init' > patch_init`
3.  `cp /usr/lib/xen/boot/stubdom-linux-rootfs > stubdom-linux-rootfs.orig`
4.  `chmod +x patch_init`
5.  `./patch_init`

# Download the installer
6.  Download an installer image from https://www.android-x86.org/download. I
use android-x86_64-9.0-r2.iso.

# Create the Android qube
7.  `qvm-create --standalone -l red --property kernel='' --property virt_mode=HVM --property memory=4000 reaction`
8.  `qvm-start reaction --cdrom-qube1:/home/user/Downloads/android-x86_64-9.0-r2.iso`.
    Choose the option to Install to harddisk
    Create/Modify partitions - say "No" to GPT, and create a New
Primary partition. Accept the default size; make it Bootable;Write:Quit.
    In the Installer, the partition you created will be highlighted.  Click OK
    Format as ext4. Select "Yes" to Confirm.
    Say "Yes" to Install GRUB boot loader.
    Say "Yes" to Install /system as read-write.

    Once installation has completed, select "Reboot" - the qube will shut down.

9.  Make sure that the new qube is connected to a netvm
10.  `qvm-start reaction `
