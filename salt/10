The file module also lets us do some basic editing.
The states are pretty obvious:
file.line, file.comment, file.append, file.prepend, file.uncomment

The syntax isnt always so obvious.

Let's look at an example:

edit.sls

The Mode statemt has to be included:
ensure  - you have to specify "before" or "after"
replace
delete
insert - you have to specify "before", "after", or "location"

Location:
start
end

Before:
After:
You can use exact fragments of a string *or* use regex

And of course we can set:
user
group
and file permissions using file_mode.
And produce a backup file by setting 'backup: True'


The other editing options are as easy to use:
append/prepend
comment/uncomment - here you can specify the comment character to use, and
whether to keep a backup.

Again, we can use a regex to specify the lines to be edited.

comment.sls

By default, a backup file will be created. Check that.
You can omit "char" as '#' will be used by default 


What if we want to insert more than one line?
One way is to feed multiple lines liek this:

edit6.sls

Another method is to use file.blockreplace - this allows you to mark out
sections of a file and work within them.
Like this:

block.sls
