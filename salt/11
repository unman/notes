Recap on targeting.

In the editing example we were targeting one qube.
We specified it in the top file and also in the call to qubesctl.
qubesctl --targets browser state.apply

We can use salt to control *man* qubes.
We've already seen this when updating templates. One call to qubesctl will update
*all* the templates. (try to).

Let's look at how this works, using filecopy. 

filecopy.top

Instead of specifying browser, we can use a wild card:

base:
  brows*:
  - filecopy

Remember how we can target qubesctl?
When updating templates, we used '--templates' - we can also use '-- apps'.

See what happened? We iterated over every appVM, and skipped those that
didnt match browse*
Not very efficient.
Even though the top file contains a wildcard, we can target specific qubes:

qubesctl --targets browser3,browser4 state.apply


You may be wondering why we dont always use a wildcard in the top file?
Why not just have:

base:
  '*':
  - filecopy

(Notice that * has to be quoted)
That works fine, and we can limit the targets using --targets..

Why not do this all the time?
Risk management.

What else can we specify in top file?
Remember for updating templates we used this:
base:
  qubes:type:template:
  - match: pillar

There are other types we can use here:
qubes:type:admin
qubes:type:standalone
qubes:type:app

type:admin can be used for dom0 or for an adminVM.

If you use --targets and it doesn't match the qubes:type in the top file,
then salt will SKIP.

Salt also provides a mechanism for getting and using information about the
underlying qubes. It's called "grains" because it provides grains of
information.
Using grains allows for very precise targeting.
