All this top.enable, state.apply and top.disable may seem excessive.
There's an easier way to run state files. 
You can apply a state in dom0 like this:
qubesctl state.sls <foo>

By combining states in to one top file, you can clone a template
and create a qube based on it with one command.

Alternatively you can combine all the states in to one sls file:
allinone.sls

If you look at the files in /srv/formulas/base/virtual-machines-formula/qvm,
you can see how this works for the default qubes.

You'll see a difference between those files and allinone.sls.
Those files use a template, which simplifies the specification of states.
Otherwise, most of the detail in those files should look very familiar
now.

You can include that template in your own files if you wish.

So far there's nothing that couldn't have been done using dom0 qvm tools:
qvm-clone, qvm-create and qvm-prefs.
You *could* do this using a batch file.
